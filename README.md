# Inbox (IMAP/MSGRAPH) processor for SCOT4

Creates a container to run the SCOT4 inbox processor.  The processor will read IMAP inboxes and Microsoft Graph API inboxes and insert the contents of those messages into SCOT alerts, events, or dispatches.

This is a convenient way to input data from detection systems, threat intel feeds, and analysts directly into SCOT.

For more information and instructions, consult the main SCOT4 documentaton Repository.
